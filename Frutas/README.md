#  Frutas App

Implementation steps

## 1. Build the Card View for a Fruit
    - Create a VStack containing the info for the fruit we want, such as the fruit name, a description, the image, and a button
    - Contain the VStack in a ZStack container where we can add background and format it as a gradient, as well as adding animations
    
## 2. Format the Start Button as its own view, and just import it into the Card View
## 3. Create an Onboarding View, where for now, we hard-code in a for loop of 5 so that we can display the card five times
## 4. Import into the main FrutasApp file
